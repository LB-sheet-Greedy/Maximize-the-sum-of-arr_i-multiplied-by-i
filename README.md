# Maximize-the-sum-of-arr_i-multiplied-by-i

Question >>

Given an array of N integers. You are allowed to rearrange the elements of the array. The task is to find the maximum value of Σarr[i]*i, where i = 0, 1, 2,…., n – 1.

Examples >>

Input : N = 4, arr[] = { 3, 5, 6, 1 }
Output : 31
If we arrange arr[] as { 1, 3, 5, 6 }. 
Sum of arr[i]*i is 1*0 + 3*1 + 5*2 + 6*3 
= 31, which is maximum

Input : N = 2, arr[] = { 19, 20 }
Output : 20
